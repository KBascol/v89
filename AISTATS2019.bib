  author	= {Pedregosa, Fabian and Fatras, Kilian and Casotto, Mattia},
  pages		= {1-10},
  abstract	= {Despite the raise to fame of stochastic variance reduced methods like SAGA and ProxSVRG, their use in non-smooth optimization is still limited to a few simple cases. Existing methods require to compute the proximal operator of the non-smooth term at each iteration, which, for complex penalties like the total variation, overlapping group lasso or trend filtering, is an iterative process that becomes unfeasible for moderately large problems. In this work we propose and analyze VRTOS, a variance-reduced method to solve problems with an arbitrary number of non-smooth terms. Like other variance reduced methods, it only requires to evaluate one gradient per iteration and converges with a constant step size, and so is ideally suited for large scale applications. Unlike existing variance reduced methods, it admits multiple non-smooth terms whose proximal operator only needs to be evaluated once per iteration. We provide a convergence rate analysis for the proposed methods that achieves the same asymptotic rate as their full gradient variants and illustrate its computational advantage on 4 different large scale datasets.}

  abstract	= {We derive the optimal $(0, \delta)$-differentially private query-output independent noise-adding mechanism for single real-valued query function under a general cost-minimization framework. Under a mild technical condition, we show that the optimal noise probability distribution is a uniform distribution with a probability mass at the origin. We explicitly derive the optimal noise distribution for general $\ell^p$ cost functions, including $\ell^1$ (for noise magnitude) and $\ell^2$ (for noise power) cost functions, and show that the probability concentration on the origin occurs when $\delta > \frac{p}{p+1}$. Our result demonstrates an improvement over the existing Gaussian mechanisms  by a factor of two and three for $(0,\delta)$-differential privacy in the high privacy regime in the context of minimizing the noise magnitude and noise power, and the gain is more pronounced in the low privacy regime. Our result is consistent with the existing result for $(0,\delta)$-differential privacy in the discrete setting, and identifies a probability concentration phenomenon in the continuous setting.}

We study the performance of the monotone constrained likelihood estimate, which is equivalent to the estimate produced by isotonic regression. We derive adaptive and non-adaptive bounds on the performance of the isotonic estimate, i.e., we demonstrate that for some probability vectors the isotonic estimate converges much faster than in general. As an application of this framework we propose a two step procedure for the binary monotone single index model, which consists of running LASSO and consequently running an isotonic regression. We provide thorough numerical studies in support of our claims.}

We use our general results to analyze three functional shape constrained problems where the signal is generated from an underlying Lipschitz, monotone or convex function. In each of the examples we show specific classes of functions which achieve fast adaptive estimation rates, and we also provide non-adaptive estimation rates which hold for any function. Our results demonstrate that the Lipschitz, monotone and convex constraints allow one to analyze regression problems even in high-dimensional settings where the dimension may scale as the square or fourth degree of the sample size respectively.}

This is done under standard assumptions, for which we derive stronger versions of a cone condition and a restricted strong convexity. Our bound holds with high probability and in expectation and applies to an L1-regularized estimator and to a recently introduced Slope estimator, which we generalize for classification problems.  Slope presents the advantage of adapting to unknown sparsity. Thus, we propose a tractable proximal algorithm to compute it and assess its empirical performance. Our results match the best existing bounds for classification and regression problems.}

Most models however, do not generalize to populations outside the marginal and conditional distribution assumptions for which they were derived. This presents a significant barrier to the deployment of machine learning techniques into wider clinical practice as most medical studies are data scarce, especially for the analysis of time-to-event outcomes. In this work we propose a survival prediction model that is able to improve predictions on a small data domain of interest - such as a local hospital - by leveraging related data from other domains - such as data from other hospitals. We construct an ensemble of weak survival predictors which iteratively adapt the marginal distributions of the source and target data such that similar source patients contribute to the fit and ultimately improve predictions on target patients of interest. This represents the first boosting-based transfer learning algorithm in the survival analysis literature. We demonstrate the performance and utility of our algorithm on synthetic and real healthcare data collected at various locations.}

We demonstrate that LARS priors improve VAE performance on several standard datasets both when they are learned jointly with the rest of the model and when they are fitted to a pretrained model. Finally, we show that LARS can be combined with existing methods for defining flexible priors for an additional boost in performance.}

In this paper, we use distribution optimization techniques to approximate the posterior distribution, solved via Wasserstein gradient flows. Based on the framework, a principled particle-optimization algorithm is developed for TS to approximate the posterior efficiently. Our approach is scalable and does not make explicit distribution assumptions on posterior approximations.  Extensive experiments on both synthetic data and large-scale real data demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods.}

However, existing datasets are often cross-sectional with each individual observed only once, making it impossible to apply traditional time-series methods. Motivated by the study of human aging, we present an interpretable latent-variable model that learns temporal dynamics from cross-sectional data. Our model represents each individual's features over time as a nonlinear function of a low-dimensional, linearly-evolving latent state. We prove that when this nonlinear function is constrained to be order-isomorphic, the model family is identifiable solely from cross-sectional data provided the distribution of time-independent variation is known. On the UK Biobank human health dataset, our model reconstructs the observed data while learning interpretable rates of aging associated with diseases, mortality, and aging risk factors.}

  abstract	= {Methods based on Bayesian decision tree ensembles have proven valuable in constructing high-quality predictions, and are particularly attractive in certain settings because they encourage low-order interaction effects. Despite adapting to the presence of low-order interactions for prediction purpose, we show that Bayesian decision tree ensembles are generally anti-conservative for the purpose of conducting interaction detection. We address this problem by introducing Dirichlet process forests (DP-Forests), which leverage the presence of low-order interactions by clustering the trees so that trees within the same cluster focus on detecting a specific interaction. We show on both simulated and benchmark data that DP-Forests perform well relative to existing interaction detection techniques for detecting low-order interactions, attaining very low false-positive and false-negative rates while maintaining the same performance for prediction using a comparable computational budget.}

  abstract	= {Machine learning systems increasingly depend on pipelines of multiple algorithms to provide high quality and well structured predictions. This paper argues interaction effects between clustering and prediction (e.g. classification, regression) algorithms can cause subtle adverse behaviors during cross-validation that may not be initially apparent. In particular, we focus on the problem of estimating the out-of-cluster (OOC) prediction loss given an approximate clustering with probabilistic error rate p_0. Traditional cross-validation techniques exhibit significant empirical bias in this setting, and  the few attempts to estimate and correct for these effects are intractable on larger datasets. Further, no previous work has been able to characterize the conditions under which these empirical effects occur, and if they do, what properties they have. We precisely answer these questions by providing theoretical properties which hold in various settings, and prove that expected out-of-cluster loss behavior rapidly decays with even minor clustering errors. Fortunately, we are able to leverage these same properties to construct hypothesis tests and scalable estimators necessary for correcting the problem. Empirical results on benchmark datasets validate our theoretical results and demonstrate how scaling techniques provide solutions to new classes of problems.}

Despite many efforts in this area, there were no rigorous theoretical guarantees on why existing neural net compression methods should work. In this paper, we provide provable guarantees on some hashing-based parameter reduction methods in neural nets. First, we introduce a neural net compression scheme based on random linear sketching (which is usually implemented efficiently via hashing), and show that the sketched (smaller) network is able to approximate the original network on all input data coming from any smooth well-conditioned low-dimensional manifold. The sketched network can also be trained directly via back-propagation. Next, we study the previously proposed HashedNets architecture and show that the optimization landscape of one-hidden-layer HashedNets has a local strong convexity property similar to a normal fully connected neural network. Together with the initialization algorithm developed in [51], this implies that the parameters in HashedNets can be provably recovered. We complement our theoretical results with some empirical verification.}

In this paper, we introduce the Riemannian SPIDER (R-SPIDER) method as a novel nonlinear-metric extension of SPIDER for efficient non-convex optimization on Riemannian manifolds. We prove that for finite-sum problems with $n$ components, R-SPIDER converges to an $\epsilon$-accuracy stationary point within $\mathcal{O}\big(\min\big(n+\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\epsilon^2},\frac{1}{\epsilon^3}\big)\big)$ stochastic gradient evaluations, which is sharper in magnitude than the prior Riemannian first-order methods. For online optimization, R-SPIDER is shown to converge with $\mathcal{O}\big(\frac{1}{\epsilon^3}\big)$ complexity which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first non-asymptotic result for online Riemannian optimization. Especially, for gradient dominated functions, we further develop a variant of R-SPIDER and prove its linear convergence rate. Numerical results demonstrate the computational efficiency of the proposed methods.}

This enables the introduction of new inference engines that are able to exploit gradient information, while remaining efficient for models which are not everywhere differentiable. We demonstrate this ability by incorporating a discontinuous Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (DHMC) inference engine that is able to deliver automated and efficient inference for non-differentiable models. Our system is backed up by a mathematical formalism that ensures that any model expressed in this language has a density with measure zero discontinuities to maintain the validity of the inference engine.}

This computational speedup is accompanied by regret bounds of order $(1+\varepsilon_m)^{3/2}d\sqrt{T}$ for OFUL and of order $\big((1+\varepsilon_m)d\big)^{3/2}\sqrt{T}$ for Thompson Sampling, where $\varepsilon_m$ is bounded by the sum of the tail eigenvalues not covered by the sketch.

However, with so many ambient sensors collecting different measurements, it becomes important not only to maintain good monitoring accuracy, but also low power consumption to ensure sustainable monitoring. This power-efficient sensing scheme can be achieved by deciding which group of sensors to use at a given time, requiring an accurate characterization of the trade-off between sensor energy usage and the uncertainty in ignoring certain sensor signals while monitor- ing. To address this challenge in the context of activity monitoring, we have designed an adaptive activity monitoring framework. We first propose a switching Gaussian process to model the observed sensor signals emitting from the underlying activity states. To efficiently compute the Gaussian process model likelihood and quantify the context prediction uncertainty, we propose a block circulant embedding technique and use Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) for inference. By computing the Bayesian loss function tailored to switching Gaussian processes, an adaptive monitoring procedure is developed to select features from available sensors that optimize the trade-off between sensor power consumption and the prediction performance quantified by state prediction entropy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on the popular benchmark of UCI Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones.}

  abstract	= {Composite convex optimization problems which include both a nonsmooth term and a low-rank promoting term have important applications in machine learning and signal processing, such as when one wishes to recover an unknown matrix that is  simultaneously low-rank and sparse. However, such problems are highly challenging to solve in large-scale: the low-rank promoting term prohibits efficient implementations of proximal methods for composite optimization and even simple subgradient methods. On the other hand, methods which are tailored for low-rank optimization, such as conditional gradient-type methods, which are often applied to a smooth approximation of the nonsmooth objective, are slow since their runtime scales with both the large Lipchitz parameter of the smoothed gradient vector and with $1/\epsilon$, where $\epsilon$ is the target accuracy. In this paper we develop efficient algorithms for \textit{stochastic} optimization of a strongly-convex objective which includes both a nonsmooth term and a low-rank promoting term. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, we present the first algorithm that enjoys all following critical properties for large-scale problems: i) (nearly) optimal sample complexity, ii) each iteration requires only a single \textit{low-rank} SVD computation, and iii) overall number of thin-SVD computations scales only with $\log{1/\epsilon}$ (as opposed to $\textrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ in previous methods). We also give an algorithm for the closely-related finite-sum setting. We empirically demonstrate our results on the problem of recovering a simultaneously low-rank and sparse matrix.}

  pages		= {295-303},
  abstract	= {Hoffman's classical result gives a bound on the distance of a point from a convex and compact polytope in terms of the magnitude of violation of the constraints. Recently, several results showed that Hoffman's bound can be used to derive strongly-convex-like rates for first-order methods for \textit{offline} convex optimization of curved, though not strongly convex, functions, over polyhedral sets. In this work, we use this classical result for the first time to obtain faster rates for \textit{online convex optimization} over polyhedral sets with curved convex, though not strongly convex, loss functions. We show that under several reasonable assumptions on the data, the standard \textit{Online Gradient Descent} algorithm guarantees logarithmic regret. To the best of our knowledge, the only previous algorithm to achieve logarithmic regret in the considered settings is the \textit{Online Newton Step} algorithm which requires quadratic (in the dimension) memory and at least quadratic runtime per iteration, which greatly limits its applicability to large-scale problems. In particular, our results hold for  \textit{semi-adversarial} settings in which the data is a combination of  an arbitrary  (adversarial) sequence and a stochastic sequence, which might provide reasonable approximation for many real-world sequences, or under a natural assumption that the data is low-rank. We demonstrate via experiments that the regret of OGD is indeed comparable to that of ONS (and even far better)  on curved though not strongly-convex losses.}

In this paper we design and analyze an accelerated coordinate descent (\texttt{ACD}) method which in each iteration updates a random subset of coordinates according to an arbitrary but fixed probability law, which is a parameter of the method.   While mini-batch variants of \texttt{ACD} are more popular and relevant in practice, there is no importance sampling for \texttt{ACD} that outperforms the standard uniform mini-batch sampling. Through insights enabled by our general analysis, we design new importance sampling for mini-batch \texttt{ACD} which significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art minibatch \texttt{ACD} in practice. We prove a rate that is at most $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\tau})$ times worse than the rate of minibatch \texttt{ACD} with uniform sampling, but can be $\mathcal{O}(n/\tau)$ times better, where $\tau$ is the minibatch size. Since in modern supervised learning training systems it is standard practice to choose $\tau \ll n$, and often $\tau=\mathcal{O}(1)$, our method can lead to dramatic speedups. Lastly, we obtain similar results for minibatch nonaccelerated  \texttt{CD} as well, achieving improvements on previous best rates.}

We remedy this by proposing augmentations to the basic IRLS routine that not only offer guaranteed global recovery, but in practice also outperform state-of-the-art algorithms for robust regression. Our routines are more immune to hyperparameter misspecification in basic regression tasks, as well as applied tasks such as linear-armed bandit problems. Our theoretical analyses rely on a novel extension of the notions of strong convexity and smoothness to weighted strong convexity and smoothness, and establishing that sub-Gaussian designs offer bounded weighted condition numbers. These notions may be useful in analyzing other algorithms as well.}

Although several efficient algorithms have been developed recently that enjoy the benefits of fast convergence rates and even regularization free, they still call for spectral initialization. To find simple initialization approach that works equally well as spectral initialization, we propose to solve blind demixing problem via Wirtinger flow with random initialization, which yields a natural implementation. To reveal the efficiency of this algorithm, we provide the global convergence guarantee concerning randomly initialized Wirtinger flow for blind demixing. Specifically, it shows that with sufficient samples, the iterates of randomly initialized Wirtinger flow can enter a local region that enjoys strong convexity and strong smoothness within a few iterations at the first stage. At the second stage, iterates of randomly initialized Wirtinger flow further converge linearly to the ground truth.}

We devise a novel experimental design framework for implicit models that improves upon previous work in two ways. First, we use the mutual information between parameters and data as the utility function, which has previously not been feasible. We achieve this by utilising Likelihood-Free Inference by Ratio Estimation (LFIRE) to approximate posterior distributions, instead of the traditional approximate Bayesian computation or synthetic likelihood methods. Secondly, we use Bayesian optimisation in order to solve the optimal design problem, as opposed to the typically used grid search or sampling-based methods.

In contrast, the present work formulates active learning as a unified optimization framework for learning the classifier, i.e., the querying of labels and the learning of models are unified to minimize a common objective for statistical learning. In addition, the proposed method avoids the issues of many previous algorithms such as inefficiency, sampling bias and sensitivity to imbalanced data distribution.

Second, domain invariance is often a far too strict requirement and does not always lead to consistent estimation, even under strong and favorable assumptions. In this work, we give generalization bounds for unsupervised domain adaptation that hold for any representation function by acknowledging the cost of non-invertibility. In addition, we show that penalizing distance between densities is often wasteful and propose a bound based on measuring the extent to which the support of the source domain covers the target domain.

In contrast, for nonconvex models it is in general unclear that this approach yields stationary points to the infimal convolution problem. To this end we analytically investigate local regularity properties of the Moreau-envelope function under prox-regularity, which allows us to establish the equivalence between stationary points of the splitting model and the original inf-convolution model. We apply our theory to characterize stationary points of the penalty objective, which is minimized by the elastic averaging SGD (EASGD) method for distributed training, showing that perfect consensus between the workers is attainable via a finite penalty parameter.

We apply our schemes to the distributed gradient descent problem and demonstrate the advantage of the approach over current fastest coded schemes.}

Models constructed via various approaches offer different strengths and weaknesses in terms of discriminative performance and calibration, but no one model is best across all datasets or even across all time horizons within a single dataset. Because we require both good calibration and good discriminative performance over different time horizons, conventional model selection and ensemble approaches are not applicable. This paper develops a novel approach that combines the collective intelligence of different underlying survival models to produce a valid survival function that is well-calibrated and offers superior discriminative performance at different time horizons.

Recently, several approaches have been proposed to learn domain invariant feature representations through adversarial deep learning.  However, label shift, where the percentage of data in each class is different between domains, has received less attention. Label shift naturally arises in many contexts, especially in behavioral studies where the behaviors are freely chosen.  In this work, we propose a method called Domain Adversarial nets for Target Shift (DATS) to address label shift while learning a domain invariant representation. This is accomplished by using distribution matching to estimate label proportions in a blind test set. We extend this framework to handle multiple domains by developing a scheme to upweight source domains most similar to the target domain. Empirical results show that this framework performs well under large label shift in synthetic and real experiments, demonstrating the practical importance.}

Since SIPS with sufficiently large neural networks learns a variety of similarities,  SIPS alleviates the need for configuring the similarity function of GE. Approximation error rate is also evaluated, and experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that graph embedding using SIPS indeed outperforms existing methods.}

This problem subsumes a wide range of estimation tasks, e.g., distribution estimation and d-dimensional mean estimation. We provide new algorithms for both the offline (non-adaptive) and adaptive versions of this problem.   In the offline setting, the set of queries are  fixed before the algorithm starts. In the regime where $n < d^2/\log(J)$, our algorithms attain $L_2$ estimation error that is independent of d. For the special case of distribution estimation, we show that projecting the output estimate of an algorithm due to [Acharya et al. 2018] on the probability simplex yields an $L_2$ error that depends only sub-logarithmically on $J$ in the regime where $n < J^2/\log(J)$. Our bounds are within a factor of at most $(\log(J))^{1/4}$ from the optimal $L_2$ error. These results show the possibility of accurate estimation of linear queries in the high-dimensional settings under the $L_2$ error criterion.  In the adaptive setting, the queries are generated over d rounds; one query at a time. In each round, a query can be chosen adaptively based on all the history of previous queries and answers. We give an algorithm for this problem with optimal $L_{\infty}$ estimation error (worst error in the estimated values for the queries w.r.t. the data distribution). Our bound matches a lower bound on the $L_{\infty}$ error in the offline version of this problem [Duchi et al. 2013].}

We prove that our new variational loss is optimized by the exact posterior marginals in the fully factorized mean-field approximation, a property that is not shared with the more conventional reverse KL inference.

We argue that this acceleration is due to the fact that Batch Normalization splits the optimization task into optimizing length and direction of the parameters separately. This allows gradient-based methods to leverage a favourable global structure in the loss landscape that we prove to exist in Learning Halfspace problems and neural network training with Gaussian inputs.

We propose to learn  nonlinear ICA by discriminating between true augmented data, or data in which the auxiliary variable has been randomized.  This enables  the framework to be implemented algorithmically through logistic regression, possibly in a neural network.

This paper fills this gap by considering learning of a certain class of non-smooth functions, which was not covered by the previous theory.  We derive the generalization error of estimators by DNNs with a ReLU activation, and show that convergence rates of the generalization by DNNs are almost optimal to estimate the non-smooth functions, while some of the popular models do not attain the optimal rate.

Our theoretical analysis rests on a key structural lemma about partial derivatives of multi-layer rectifier networks.}

  abstract	= {In this paper, we study the problem of minimizing a sum of smooth and strongly convex functions split over the nodes of a network in a decentralized fashion. We propose the algorithm ESDACD, a decentralized accelerated algorithm that only requires local synchrony. Its rate depends on the condition number $\kappa$ of the local functions  as well as the network topology and delays. Under mild assumptions on the topology of the graph, ESDACD takes a time $O((\tau_{\max} + \Delta_{\max})\sqrt{{\kappa}/{\gamma}}\ln(\epsilon^{-1}))$ to reach a precision $\epsilon$ where $\gamma$ is the spectral gap of the graph, $\tau_{\max}$ the maximum communication delay and $\Delta_{\max}$ the maximum computation time. Therefore, it matches the rate of SSDA, which is optimal when $\tau_{\max} = \Omega\left(\Delta_{\max}\right)$. Applying ESDACD to quadratic local functions leads to an accelerated randomized gossip algorithm of rate $O(  \sqrt{\theta_{\rm gossip}/n})$ where $\theta_{\rm gossip}$ is the rate of the standard randomized gossip. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first asynchronous algorithm with a provably improved rate of convergence of the second moment of the error. We illustrate these results with experiments in idealized settings.}

  abstract	= {Motivated by the pursuit of a systematic computational and algorithmic understanding of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we present a simple yet unified non-asymptotic local convergence theory for smooth two-player games, which subsumes several discrete-time gradient-based saddle point dynamics. The analysis reveals the surprising nature of the off-diagonal interaction term as both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, this interaction term explains the origin of the slow-down effect in the convergence of Simultaneous Gradient Ascent (SGA) to stable Nash equilibria. On the other hand, for the unstable equilibria, exponential convergence can be proved thanks to the interaction term, for four modified dynamics proposed to stabilize GAN training: Optimistic Mirror Descent (OMD), Consensus Optimization (CO), Implicit Updates (IU) and Predictive Method (PM). The analysis uncovers the intimate connections among these stabilizing techniques, and provides detailed characterization on the choice of learning rate. As a by-product, we present a new analysis for OMD proposed in Daskalakis, Ilyas, Syrgkanis, and Zeng [2017] with improved rates.}

It is well-known that these problems can be rewritten to a min-max problem in a Lagrangian form. However, due to the lack of convexity, their landscape is not well understood and how to find the stable equilibria of the Lagrangian function is still unknown. To bridge the gap, we study the landscape of the Lagrangian function. Further, we define a special class of Lagrangian functions. They enjoy the following two properties: 1. Equilibria are either stable or unstable (Formal definition in Section 2); 2.Stable equilibria correspond to the global optima of the original problem. We show that a generalized eigenvalue (GEV) problem, including canonical correlation analysis and other problems as special examples, belongs to the class. Specifically, we characterize its stable and unstable equilibria by leveraging an invariant group and symmetric property (more details in Section 3). Motivated by these neat geometric structures, we propose a simple, efficient, and stochastic primal-dual algorithm solving the online GEV problem. Theoretically, under sufficient conditions, we establish an asymptotic rate of convergence and obtain the first sample complexity result for the online GEV problem by diffusion approximations, which are widely used in applied probability. Numerical results are also provided to support our theory.}

In this paper, we present extreme stochastic variational inference (ESVI), a distributed, asynchronous and lock-free algorithm to perform variational inference for mixture models on massive real world datasets. ESVI overcomes the limitations of SVI by requiring that each processor only access a subset of the data and a subset of the parameters, thus providing data and model parallelism simultaneously. Our empirical study demonstrates that ESVI not only outperforms VI and SVI in wallclock-time, but also achieves a better quality solution. To further speed up computation and save memory when fitting large number of topics, we propose a variant ESVI-TOPK which maintains only the top-k important topics. Empirically, we found that using top 25\% topics suffices to achieve the same accuracy as storing all the topics.}

However, when the actions are structured, this is possible if the unknown action can be evaluated by interleaving it with the default action. We formalize this concept as learning in stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits with exchangeable actions.

Most of the current constructions assume full independence across resolutions. This assumption simplifies the inference, but it underestimates the uncertainties in transitioning from one resolution to another. This in turn results in models which are prone to overfitting in the sense of excessive sensitivity to the chosen resolution, and predictions which are non-smooth at the boundaries. Our contribution is a new construction which instead assumes conditional independence among GPs across resolutions. We show that relaxing the full independence assumption enables robustness against overfitting, and that it delivers predictions that are smooth at the boundaries. Our new model is compared against current state of the art on 2 synthetic and 9 real-world datasets. In most cases, our new conditionally independent construction performed favorably when compared against models based on the full independence assumption. In particular, it exhibits little to no signs of overfitting.}

Similarly to active exploration in multi-armed bandit (MAB), states may have different levels of noise, so that the higher the noise, the more samples are needed. As the noise level is initially unknown, we need to trade off the exploration of the environment to estimate the noise and the exploitation of these estimates to compute a policy maximizing the accuracy of the mean predictions. We introduce a novel learning algorithm to solve this problem showing that active exploration in MDPs may be significantly more difficult than in MAB. We also derive a heuristic procedure to mitigate the negative effect of slowly mixing policies. Finally, we validate our findings on simple numerical simulations.}

In this paper, we start closing this gap: we theoretically analyze in the convex and non-convex settings a generalized version of the AdaGrad stepsizes. We show sufficient conditions for these stepsizes to achieve almost sure asymptotic convergence of the gradients to zero, proving the first guarantee for generalized AdaGrad stepsizes in the non-convex setting. Moreover, we show that these stepsizes allow to automatically adapt to the level of noise of the stochastic gradients in both the convex and non-convex settings, interpolating between O(1/T) and O(1/sqrt(T)), up to logarithmic terms.}

Since the challenging case of feedback with unknown delays prevents one from constructing the sought gradient estimates, existing MAB and BCO algorithms become intractable. Delayed exploration, exploitation, and exponential (DEXP3) iterations, along with delayed bandit gradient descent (DBGD) iterations are developed for MAB and BCO with unknown delays, respectively. Based on a unifying analysis framework, it is established that both DEXP3 and DBGD guarantee an $\tilde{\cal O}\big( \sqrt{K(T+D)} \big)$ regret, where $D$ denotes the delay accumulated over $T$ slots, and $K$ represents the number of arms in MAB or the dimension of decision variables in BCO.

Methods to improve model reliability often require new learning algorithms (e.g. using Bayesian inference to obtain uncertainty estimates). An alternative is to audit a model after it is trained. In this paper, we describe resampling uncertainty estimation (RUE), an algorithm to audit the pointwise reliability of predictions. Intuitively, RUE estimates the amount that a prediction would change if the model had been fit on different training data. The algorithm uses the gradient and Hessian of the model's loss function to create an ensemble of predictions. Experimentally, we show that RUE more effectively detects inaccurate predictions than existing tools for auditing reliability subsequent to training. We also show that RUE can create predictive distributions that are competitive with state-of-the-art methods like Monte Carlo dropout, probabilistic backpropagation, and deep ensembles, but does not depend on specific algorithms at train-time like these methods do.}

We investigate the asymptotic statistics of the FIM's eigenvalues and reveal that most of them are close to zero while the maximum eigenvalue takes a huge value. Because the landscape of the parameter space is defined by the FIM, it is locally flat in most dimensions, but strongly distorted in others. Moreover, we demonstrate the potential usage of the derived statistics in learning strategies. First, small eigenvalues that induce flatness can be connected to a norm-based capacity measure of generalization ability. Second, the maximum eigenvalue that induces the distortion enables us to quantitatively estimate an appropriately sized learning rate for gradient methods to converge.}

Thus, the task is to identify a portion of the distribution on which a linear rule can provide a good fit. Algorithms for this task are useful in cases where portions of the distribution are not modeled well by simple, learnable rules, but on other portions such rules perform well. The prior state-of-the-art for such algorithms could only guarantee finding a condition of probability $O(\mu/n^k )$ when a condition of probability $\mu$ exists, and achieved a $O(n^k)$-approximation to the target loss. Here, we give efficient algorithms for solving this task with a condition $c$ that nearly matches the probability of the ideal condition, while also improving the approximation to the target loss to a $O ~(n^{k/2})$ factor.

In particular, if $\sigma(x) = a_0+a_1x+a_3x^3$, we prove that no polynomial-time algorithm can outperform the trivial predictor that assigns to  each example the response variable $E(y)$, when $d^{3/2}<< r <<d^2$.  Our conclusion holds for a 'natural data distribution', namely standard Gaussian feature vectors $x$, and output distributed according to a two-layer neural network with random isotropic weights, and under a certain complexity-theoretic assumption on tensor decomposition. Roughly speaking, we assume that no polynomial-time algorithm can substantially outperform current methods for tensor decomposition  based on the sum-of-squares hierarchy.  We also prove generalizations of this statement for higher degree polynomial activations, and non-random weight vectors. Remarkably, several existing algorithms for learning two-layer networks with rigorous guarantees are based on tensor decomposition. Our results support the idea that this is indeed the core computational difficulty in learning such networks, under the stated generative model for the data. As a side result, we show that under this model learning the network requires accurate learning of its weights, a property that does not hold in a more general setting.}

We show that one cause for such success is due to the fact that the multi-branch architecture is less non-convex in terms of duality gap. The duality gap measures the degree of intrinsic non-convexity of an optimization problem: smaller gap in relative value implies lower degree of intrinsic non-convexity. The challenge is to quantitatively measure the duality gap of highly non-convex problems such as deep neural networks. In this work, we provide strong guarantees of this quantity for two classes of network architectures. For the neural networks with arbitrary activation functions, multi-branch architecture and a variant of hinge loss, we show that the duality gap of both population and empirical risks shrinks to zero as the number of branches increases. This result sheds light on better understanding the power of over-parametrization where increasing the number of branches tends to make the loss surface less non-convex. For the neural networks with linear activation function and $\ell_2$ loss, we show that the duality gap of empirical risk is zero. Our two results work for arbitrary depths, while the analytical techniques might be of independent interest to non-convex optimization more broadly.

We propose Hadamard Response (HR), a local privatization scheme that requires no shared randomness and is symmetric with respect to the users. Our scheme has order optimal sample complexity for all $\eps$, a communication of at most $\log k+2$ bits per user, and nearly linear running time of $\tilde{O}(n + k)$.   Our encoding and decoding are based on Hadamard matrices and are simple to implement. The statistical performance relies on the coding theoretic aspects of Hadamard matrices, ie, the large Hamming distance between the rows. An efficient implementation of the algorithm using the Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform gives the computational gains.  We compare our approach with Randomized Response (RR), RAPPOR, and subset-selection mechanisms (SS), both theoretically, and experimentally.

In this work, we use a linear approximation to the dependence of the fitting procedure on the weights, producing results that can be faster than repeated re-fitting by an order of magnitude. This linear approximation is sometimes known as the "infinitesimal jackknife" in the statistics literature, where it is mostly used as a theoretical tool to prove asymptotic results. We provide explicit finite-sample error bounds for the infinitesimal jackknife in terms of a small number of simple, verifiable assumptions. Our results apply whether the weights and data are stochastic or deterministic, and so can be used as a tool for proving the accuracy of the infinitesimal jackknife on a wide variety of problems. As a corollary, we state mild regularity conditions under which our approximation consistently estimates true leave k-out cross-validation for any fixed k.

We prove that the asymptotic error bounds of the bandit algorithms exactly match their full information counterparts. The cost of restricted feedback is reflected in the larger sample complexity. Experimental results also support our theoretical findings, and performance of the proposed models is comparable to that of an existing bandit boosting algorithm, which is limited to use binary weak learners.}

  abstract	= {Advances in unsupervised learning enable reconstruction and generation of samples from complex distributions, but this success is marred by the inscrutability of the representations learned. We propose an information-theoretic approach to characterizing disentanglement and dependence in representation learning using multivariate mutual information, also called total correlation. The principle of Total Cor-relation Ex-planation (CorEx) has motivated successful unsupervised learning applications across a variety of domains but under some restrictive assumptions. Here we relax those restrictions by introducing a flexible variational lower bound to CorEx. Surprisingly, we find this lower bound is equivalent to the one in variational autoencoders (VAE) under certain conditions. This information-theoretic view of VAE deepens our understanding of hierarchical VAE and motivates a new algorithm, AnchorVAE, that makes latent codes more interpretable through information maximization and enables generation of richer and more realistic samples.}

In this paper, we study the problem of \emph{data valuation} by utilizing the Shapley value, a popular notion of value which originated in coopoerative game theory. The Shapley value defines a unique payoff scheme that satisfies many desiderata for the notion of data value. However, the Shapley value often requires \emph{exponential} time to compute. To meet this challenge, we propose a repertoire of efficient algorithms for approximating the Shapley value. We also demonstrate the value of each training instance for various benchmark datasets.}

In these cases, the estimation of the actual query location is also subject to uncertainty. In this context, we propose an upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithm for BO problems where both the outcome of a query and the true query location are uncertain. The algorithm employs a Gaussian process model that takes probability distributions as inputs. Theoretical results are provided for both the proposed algorithm and a conventional UCB approach within the uncertain-inputs setting. Finally, we evaluate each method's performance experimentally, comparing them to other input noise aware BO approaches on simulated scenarios involving synthetic and real data.}

We also show that this condition implies that SGD can find a first-order stationary point as efficiently as full gradient descent in non-convex settings. Under interpolation, we further show that all smooth loss functions with a finite-sum structure satisfy a weaker growth condition. Given this weaker condition, we prove that SGD with a constant step-size attains the deterministic convergence rate in both the strongly-convex and convex settings.

LCC, which leverages the well-known Lagrange polynomial to create computation redundancy in a novel coded form across workers, can be applied to any computation scenario in which the function of interest is an arbitrary multivariate polynomial of the input dataset, hence covering many computations of interest in machine learning. LCC significantly generalizes prior works to go beyond linear computations. It also enables secure and private computing in distributed settings, improving the computation and communication efficiency of the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we prove the optimality of LCC by showing that it achieves the optimal tradeoff between resiliency, security, and privacy, i.e., in terms of tolerating the maximum number of stragglers and adversaries, and providing data privacy against the maximum number of colluding workers. Finally, we show via experiments on Amazon EC2 that LCC speeds up the conventional uncoded implementation of distributed least-squares linear regression by up to $13.43\times$, and also achieves a $2.36\times$-$12.65\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art straggler mitigation strategies.}

Model consistency consists then in selecting the correct structure (for instance support or rank) by regularized empirical risk minimization. It is known that model consistency holds under appropriate non-degeneracy conditions. However such conditions typically fail for highly correlated designs and it is observed that regularization methods tend to select larger models. In this work, we provide the theoretical underpinning of this behavior using the notion of mirror-stratifiable regularizers. This class of regularizers encompasses the most well-known in the literature, including the L1 or trace norms. It brings into play a pair of primal-dual models, which in turn allows one to locate the structure of the solution using a specific dual certificate. We also show how this analysis is applicable to optimal solutions of the learning problem, and also to the iterates computed by a certain class of stochastic proximal-gradient algorithms.}

An important consequence of this definition is that a kernel approximation matrix must be high rank to attain close approximation. Because storing a high-rank approximation is memory intensive, we propose using a low-precision quantization of random Fourier features (LP-RFFs) to build a high-rank approximation under a memory budget. Theoretically, we show quantization has a negligible effect on generalization performance in important settings. Empirically, we demonstrate across four benchmark datasets that LP-RFFs can match the performance of full-precision RFFs and the Nystr\"{o}m method, with 3x-10x and 50x-460x less memory, respectively.}

However, this still leaves a huge gap between sublinear $O(1/\epsilon)$ convergence and linear $O(\log 1/\epsilon)$ convergence to reach an $\epsilon$-approximate solution.

One obvious drawback of ensembling is its higher execution cost during inference. In this paper, we first describe our insights on the relationship between the probability of prediction and the effect of ensembling with current deep neural networks; ensembling does not help mispredictions for inputs predicted with a high probability even when there is a non-negligible number of mispredicted inputs. This finding motivated us to develop a way to adaptively control the ensembling. If the prediction for an input reaches a high enough probability, i.e., the output from the softmax function, on the basis of the confidence level, we stop ensembling for this input to avoid wasting computation power. We evaluated the adaptive ensembling by using various datasets and showed that it reduces the computation cost significantly while achieving accuracy similar to that of static ensembling using a pre-defined number of local predictions. We also show that our statistically rigorous confidence-level-based early-exit condition reduces the burden of task-dependent threshold tuning better compared with naive early exit based on a pre-defined threshold in addition to yielding a better accuracy with the same cost.}

We leverage tools from operator-valued kernels and the associated vector-valued RKHSs that provide an explicit control over the role of the hyperparameters, and also allows us to consider new type of constraints.

State-of-the-art theoretical work on learning Gaussian mixture models has mostly focused on estimating the mixture parameters, where clustering is given as a byproduct. These methods have focused mostly on improving separation bounds for different mixture classes, and doing so in polynomial time and sample complexity. Less emphasis has been given to aligning these algorithms to the challenges of big data. In this paper, we focus on clustering $n$ samples from an arbitrary mixture of $c$-separated Gaussians in $\mathbb{R}^p$ in time that is linear in $p$ and $n$, and  sample complexity that is independent of $p$. Our analysis suggests that for sufficiently separated Gaussians after $o(\log{p})$ random projections a good direction is found that yields a small clustering error. Specifically, for a user-specified error $e$, the expected number of such projections is small and bounded by $o(\ln p)$ when $\gamma\leq c\sqrt{\ln{\ln{p}}}$ and $\gamma=Q^{-1}(e)$ is the separation of the Gaussians with $Q$ as the tail distribution function of the normal distribution.  Consequently, the  expected overall running time of the algorithm is linear in $n$ and quasi-linear in $p$ at $o(\ln{p})O(np)$, and the sample complexity is independent of $p$. Unlike the methods that are based on $k$-means, our analysis is applicable to any mixture class (spherical or non-spherical). Finally, an extension to $k>2$ components is also provided.}

  abstract	= {We focus in this paper on high-dimensional regression problems where each regressor can be associated to a location in a physical space, or more generally a generic geometric space. Such problems often employ sparse priors, which promote models using a small subset of regressors. To increase statistical power, the so-called multi-task techniques were proposed, which consist in the simultaneous estimation of several related models. Combined with sparsity assumptions, it lead to models enforcing the active regressors to be shared across models, thanks to, for instance L1/Lq norms. We argue in this paper that these techniques fail to leverage the spatial information associated to regressors. Indeed, while sparse priors enforce that only a small subset of variables is used, the assumption that these regressors overlap across all tasks is overly simplistic given the spatial variability observed in real data. In this paper, we propose a convex regularizer for multi-task regression that encodes a more flexible geometry. Our regularizer is based on unbalanced optimal transport (OT) theory, and can take into account a prior geometric knowledge on the regressor variables, without necessarily requiring overlapping supports. We derive an efficient algorithm based on a regularized formulation of OT, which iterates through applications of Sinkhorn's algorithm along with coordinate descent iterations. The performance of our model is demonstrated on regular grids with both synthetic and real datasets as well as complex triangulated geometries of the cortex with an application in neuroimaging.}

In traditional analysis using a consistency property of loss functions, it is known that the expected classification error converges more slowly than the expected risk even when assuming a low-noise condition on the conditional label probabilities. Consequently, the resulting rate is sublinear.  Therefore, it is important to consider whether much faster convergence of the expected classification error can be achieved. In recent research, an exponential convergence rate for stochastic gradient descent was shown under a strong low-noise condition but provided theoretical analysis was limited to the square loss function, which is somewhat inadequate for binary classification tasks. In this paper,  we show an exponential convergence of the expected classification error in the final phase of the stochastic gradient descent for a wide class of differentiable convex loss functions under similar assumptions. As for the averaged stochastic gradient descent, we show that the same convergence rate holds from the early phase of training.

We exploit the measure-theoretic view of a shift-invariant kernel given by the Bochner's theorem, and automatically learn the measure in terms of a parameterized quantile function. This flexible black box quantile function, evaluated on Quasi-Monte Carlo samples, builds up quasi-random Fourier feature maps that can approximate arbitrary kernels. The proposed method is not only general enough to be used in any kernel machine, but can also be combined with other kernel design techniques. We learn expressive kernels on a variety of datasets, verifying the methods ability to automatically  discover complex patterns without being guided by human expert knowledge.}

  abstract	= {Complex computer simulators are increasingly used across fields of science as generative models tying parameters of an underlying theory to experimental observations. Inference in this setup is often difficult, as simulators rarely admit a tractable density or likelihood function. We introduce Adversarial Variational Optimization (AVO), a likelihood-free inference algorithm for fitting a non-differentiable generative model incorporating ideas from generative adversarial networks, variational optimization and empirical Bayes. We adapt the training procedure of generative adversarial networks by replacing the differentiable generative network with a domain-specific simulator. We solve the resulting non-differentiable minimax problem by minimizing variational upper bounds of the two adversarial objectives. Effectively, the procedure results in learning a proposal distribution over simulator parameters, such that the JS divergence between the marginal distribution of the synthetic data and the empirical distribution of observed data is minimized. We evaluate and compare the method with simulators producing both discrete and continuous data.}

  abstract	= {Pre-conditioning is a well-known concept that can significantly improve the convergence of optimization algorithms. For noise-free problems, where good pre-conditioners are not known a priori, iterative linear algebra methods offer one way to efficiently construct them. For the stochastic optimization problems that dominate contemporary machine learning, however, this approach is not readily available. We propose an iterative algorithm inspired by classic iterative linear solvers that uses a probabilistic model to actively infer a pre-conditioner in situations where Hessian-projections can only be constructed with strong Gaussian noise. The algorithm is empirically demonstrated to efficiently construct effective pre-conditioners for stochastic gradient descent and its variants. Experiments on problems of comparably low dimensionality show improved convergence. In very high-dimensional problems, such as those encountered in deep learning, the pre-conditioner effectively becomes an automatic learning-rate adaptation scheme, which we also show to empirically work well.}

Under these assumptions we design a new  approximate projection operation that necessitates only logarithmically many calls to these oracles.

However, in reality the connection structure usually does not stay the same across cascades.  For example, different people have different topics of interest, therefore the connection structure depends on the information/topic content of the cascade.  In this paper we consider the case where we observe a sequence of noisy adjacency matrices triggered by information/events with different topic distributions.  We propose a novel latent model using the intuition that a connection is more likely to exist between two nodes if they are interested in similar topics, which are common with the information/event.  Specifically, we endow each node with two node-topic vectors: an influence vector that measures how influential/authoritative they are on each topic; and a receptivity vector that measures how receptive/susceptible they are to each topic.  We show how these two node-topic structures can be estimated from observed adjacency matrices with theoretical guarantee on estimation error, in cases where the topic distributions of the information/events are known, as well as when they are unknown. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of our model and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.}

As many low-paid workers are prone to give noisy answers, a common practice is to add redundancy by assigning multiple workers to each task and then simply average out these answers. However, to fully harness the wisdom of the crowd, one needs to learn the heterogeneous quality of each worker. We resolve this fundamental challenge in crowdsourced regression tasks, i.e., the answer takes continuous labels, where identifying good or bad workers becomes much more non-trivial compared to a classification setting of discrete labels. In particular, we introduce a Bayesian iterative scheme and show that it provably achieves the optimal mean squared error. Our evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets support our theoretical results and show the superiority of the proposed scheme.}

Our approach is to directly estimate the low-rank factor by minimizing a nonconvex least-squares loss function via vanilla gradient descent, following a tailored spectral initialization. When the true rank is small, this algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the ground truth (up to global ambiguity) with near-optimal sample and computational complexities with respect to the problem size. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical guarantee that achieves near optimality in both metrics. In particular, the key enabler of near-optimal computational guarantees is an implicit regularization phenomenon: without explicit regularization, both spectral initialization and the gradient descent iterates automatically stay within a region incoherent with the measurement vectors. This feature allows one to employ much more aggressive step sizes compared with the ones suggested in prior literature, without the need of sample splitting.}

  abstract	= {Backpropagation is almost universally used to train artificial neural networks.  However, there are several reasons that backpropagation could not be plausibly implemented by biological neurons.  Among these are the facts that (1) biological neurons appear to lack any mechanism for sending gradients backwards across synapses, and (2) biological ``spiking'' neurons emit binary signals, whereas back-propagation requires that neurons communicate continuous values between one another.   Recently, Scellier and Bengio [2017], demonstrated an alternative to backpropagation, called Equilibrium Propagation, wherein gradients are implicitly computed by the dynamics of the neural network, so that neurons do not need an internal mechanism for backpropagation of gradients.  This provides an interesting solution to problem (1).  In this paper, we address problem (2) by proposing a way in which Equilibrium Propagation can be implemented with neurons which are constrained to just communicate binary values at each time step.  We show that with appropriate step-size annealing, we can converge to the same fixed-point as a real-valued neural network, and that with predictive coding, we can make this convergence much faster. We demonstrate that the resulting model can be used to train a spiking neural network using the update scheme from Equilibrium propagation.}

The dynamical system is unknown and only noisy input-output data is available. In a more general setup, the noise perturbing the data is non-white and the variance at each frequency band is unknown, resulting in a two-dimensional Gaussian bandit model with unknown mean and scaled-identity covariance matrix. This model corresponds to a two-parameter exponential family. Within a bandit framework, the set of means is given by the frequency response of the system and, unlike traditional bandit problems, the goal here is to maximize the probability of choosing the arm drawing samples with the highest norm of its mean. A problem-dependent lower bound for the expected cumulative regret is derived and a matching upper bound is obtained for a Thompson-Sampling algorithm under a uniform prior over the variances and the two-dimensional means.}

Under the same performance metric, we proceed to show that the quadratic-time MMD based two-sample tests are also optimal for general two-sample problems, provided that kernels are bounded continuous and characteristic.

First, unlike most algorithms found in the literature, the proposed methods do not rely on any critical hyper-parameter like a step size, nor do they require a line-search technique. Second, the algorithm for the finite sum setting, although stochastic, guarantees a decrease of the loss function at each iteration. Experiments demonstrate progress on the state-of-the-art for large scale datasets, without the necessity for any manual parameter tuning.}

We focus in this paper on Sinkhorn divergences (SDs), a regularized variant of OT distances which can interpolate, depending on the regularization strength $\varepsilon$, between OT ($\varepsilon=0$) and MMD ($\varepsilon=\infty$). Although the tradeoff induced by that regularization is now well understood computationally (OT, SDs and MMD require respectively $O(n^3\log n)$, $O(n^2)$ and $n^2$ operations given a sample size $n$), much less is known in terms of their sample complexity, namely the gap between these quantities, when evaluated using finite samples vs. their respective densities. Indeed, while the sample complexity of OT and MMD stand at two extremes, $1/n^{1/d}$ for OT in dimension $d$ and $1/\sqrt{n}$ for MMD, that for SDs has only been studied empirically. In this paper, we (i) derive a bound on the approximation error made with SDs when approximating OT as a function of the regularizer $\varepsilon$, (ii) prove that the optimizers of regularized OT are bounded in a Sobolev (RKHS) ball independent of the two measures and (iii) provide the first sample complexity bound for SDs, obtained,by reformulating SDs as a maximization problem in a RKHS. We thus obtain a scaling in $1/\sqrt{n}$ (as in MMD), with a constant that depends however on $\varepsilon$, making the bridge between OT and MMD complete.}

In addition, we can use these inversion models to estimate the mutual information between a model's inputs and its intermediate representations, thus quantifying the amount of information preserved by the network at different stages. Using this method we examine the types of information preserved at different layers of convolutional neural networks, and explore the invariances induced by different architectural choices.

In this work, we view de-duplication as a clustering problem where the goal is to put records corresponding to the same physical entity in the same cluster and putting records corresponding to different physical entities into different clusters.  We introduce a framework which we call promise correlation clustering. Given a complete graph G with the edges labelled 0 and 1, the goal is to find a clustering that minimizes the number of 0 edges within a cluster plus the number of 1 edges across different clusters (or correlation loss). The optimal clustering can also be viewed as a complete graph $G^*$ with edges corresponding to points in the same cluster being labelled 0 and other edges being labelled 1. Under the promise that the edge difference between G and $G^*$ is ``small", we prove that finding the optimal clustering (or $G^*$) is still NP-Hard. \cite{ashtiani2016clustering} introduced the framework of semi-supervised clustering, where the learning algorithm has access to an oracle, which answers whether two points belong to the same or different clusters. We further prove that even with access to a same-cluster oracle, the promise version is NP-Hard as long as the number queries to the oracle is not too large (o(n) where n is the number of vertices).   Given these negative results, we consider a restricted version of correlation clustering. As before, the goal is to find a clustering that minimizes the correlation loss. However, we restrict ourselves to a given class F of clusterings. We offer a semi-supervised algorithmic approach to solve the restricted variant with success guarantees.}

Numerical studies demonstrate the superior classification performance of the proposed approach compared to existing nonparametric classifiers.}

  abstract	= {Programming by examples (PBE) is a rapidly growing subfield of AI, that aims to synthesize user-intended programs using input-output examples from the task. As users can provide only a few I/O examples, capturing user-intent accurately and ranking user-intended programs over other programs is challenging even in the simplest of the domains. Commercially deployed PBE systems often require years of engineering effort and domain expertise to devise ranking heuristics for real-time synthesis of accurate programs. But such heuristics may not cater to new domains, or even to a different segment of users from the same domain. In this work, we develop a novel, real-time, ML-based program ranking algorithm that enables synthesis of natural, user-intended, personalized programs. We make two key technical contributions: 1) a new technique to embed programs in a vector space making them amenable to ML-formulations, 2) a novel formulation that interleaves program search with ranking, enabling real-time synthesis of accurate user-intended programs. We implement our solution in the state-of-the-art PROSE framework. The proposed approach learns the intended program with just {\em one} I/O example in a variety of real-world string/date/number manipulation tasks, and outperforms state-of-the-art neural synthesis methods along multiple metrics.}

  abstract	= {Bilevel optimization has been recently revisited for designing and analyzing algorithms in hyperparameter tuning and meta learning tasks. However, due to its nested structure, evaluating exact gradients for high-dimensional problems is computationally challenging. One heuristic to circumvent this difficulty is to use the approximate gradient given by performing truncated back-propagation through the iterative optimization procedure that solves the lower-level problem. Although promising empirical performance has been reported, its theoretical properties are still unclear. In this paper, we analyze the properties of this family of approximate gradients and establish sufficient conditions for convergence. We validate this on several hyperparameter tuning and meta learning tasks. We find that optimization with the approximate gradient computed using few-step back-propagation often performs comparably to optimization with the exact gradient, while requiring far less memory and half the computation time.}

This is achieved by considering the method by which data is sampled from a graph as an explicit component of model design. By integrating fast implementations of graph sampling schemes with standard automatic differentiation tools, we provide an efficient turnkey solver for the risk minimization problem. We establish basic theoretical properties of the procedure. Finally, we demonstrate relational ERM with application to two non-standard problems: one-stage training for semi-supervised node classification, and learning embedding vectors for vertex attributes. Experiments confirm that the turnkey inference procedure is effective in practice, and that the sampling scheme used for model specification has a strong effect on model performance.}

When these data entries are not missing completely at random, the (conditional) independence relations in the observed data may be different from those in the complete data generated by the underlying causal process. Consequently, simply applying existing causal discovery methods to the observed data may lead to wrong conclusions. In this paper, we aim at developing a causal discovery method to recover the underlying causal structure from observed data that are missing under different mechanisms, including missing completely at random (MCAR), missing at random (MAR), and missing not at random (MNAR). With missingness mechanisms represented by missingness graphs (m-graphs), we analyze conditions under which additional correction is needed to derive conditional independence/dependence relations in the complete data. Based on our analysis, we propose Missing Value PC (MVPC), which extends the PC algorithm to incorporate additional corrections. Our proposed MVPC is shown in theory to give asymptotically correct results even on data that are MAR or MNAR. Experimental results on both synthetic data and real healthcare applications illustrate that the proposed algorithm is able to find correct causal relations even in the general case of MNAR.}

Recently, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have achieved impressive performance on the graph-based SSL task. In addition to label scores, it is also desirable to have confidence scores associated with them. Unfortunately, confidence estimation in the context of GCN has not been previously explored. We fill this important gap in this paper and propose ConfGCN, which estimates labels scores along with their confidences jointly in GCN-based setting. ConfGCN uses these estimated confidences to determine the influence of one node on another during neighborhood aggregation, thereby acquiring anisotropic capabilities. Through extensive analysis and experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that ConfGCN is able to outperform state-of-the-art baselines.

  abstract	= {Kernel methods offer the flexibility to learn complex relationships in modern, large data sets while enjoying strong theoretical guarantees on quality. Unfortunately, these methods typically require cubic running time in the data set size, a prohibitive cost in the large- data setting. Random feature maps (RFMs) and the Nystro\"{o}m method both consider low- rank approximations to the kernel matrix as a potential solution. But, in order to achieve desirable theoretical guarantees, the former may require a prohibitively large number of features J+, and the latter may be prohibitively expensive for high-dimensional problems. We propose to combine the simplicity and generality of RFMs with a data-dependent feature selection scheme to achieve desirable theoretical approximation properties of Nyström with just $O(\log J+)$ features. Our key insight is to begin with a large set of random features, then reduce them to a small number of weighted features in a data-dependent, computationally efficient way, while preserving the statistical guarantees of using the original large set of features. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method with theory and experiments-including on a data set with over 50 million observations. In particular, we show that our method achieves small kernel matrix approximation error and better test set accuracy with provably fewer random features than state-of-the-art methods.}

The goal is to maximise the cumulative profit, where the profit obtained on a single trial is defined as the difference between the maximum reward among the selected actions and the sum of their costs. Action energy values and the budget are known and fixed. All rewards and costs associated with each action change over time and are revealed at each trial only after the learner's selection of actions. Our framework encompasses several online learning problems where the environment changes over time; and the solution trades-off between minimising the costs and maximising the maximum reward of the selected subset of actions, while being constrained to an action energy budget. The algorithm that we propose is efficient and general that may be specialised to multiple natural online combinatorial problems.}

Discrete optimal transport provides a natural and successful approach to such tasks whenever the two sets of objects can be represented in the same space, or at least distances between them can be directly evaluated. Unfortunately neither requirement is likely to hold when object representations are learned from data. Indeed, automatically derived representations such as word embeddings are typically fixed only up to some global transformations, for example, reflection or rotation. As a result, pairwise distances across two such instances are ill-defined without specifying their relative transformation. In this work, we propose a general framework for optimal transport in the presence of latent global transformations. We cast the problem as a joint optimization over transport couplings and transformations chosen from a flexible class of invariances, propose algorithms to solve it, and show promising results in various tasks, including a popular unsupervised word translation benchmark.}

We formulate the patient allocation problem as a finite stage Markov Decision Process in which the objective is to minimize a given weighted combination of type-I and type-II errors.  Because finding the exact solution to this Markov Decision Process is computationally intractable, we propose an algorithm Knowledge Gradient for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT-KG) -- that yields an approximate solution.

We consider Full Information and Bandit feedback for this problem. This problem is equivalent to OLO on the $\{0,1\}^n$ hypercube. The Exp2 algorithm and its bandit variant are commonly used strategies for this problem. It was previously unknown if it is possible to run Exp2 on the hypercube in polynomial time.

We show that our algorithm is equivalent Exp2 on $\{0,1\}^n$, Online Mirror Descent(OMD), Follow The Regularized Leader(FTRL) and Follow The Perturbed Leader(FTPL) algorithms. We show PolyExp achieves expected regret bound that is a factor of $\sqrt{n}$ better than Exp2 in the full information setting under $L_\infty$ adversarial losses. Because of the equivalence of these algorithms, this implies an improvement on Exp2's regret bound in full information. We also show matching regret lower bounds.

In this work, we show that in the context of linear classifiers and two-layer ReLU networks, there provably exist directions that give rise to adversarial perturbations for many classifiers and data points simultaneously. We show that these ``transferable adversarial directions'' are guaranteed to exist for linear separators of a given set, and will exist with high probability for linear classifiers trained on independent sets drawn from the same distribution. We extend our results to large classes of two-layer ReLU networks. We further show that adversarial directions for ReLU networks transfer to linear classifiers while the reverse need not hold, suggesting that adversarial perturbations for more complex models are more likely to transfer to other classifiers. We validate our findings empirically, even for deeper ReLU networks.}

This commonly yields solutions that do not have a closed form or that are restricted to specific covariance functions. We introduce a novel finite approximation of GP-modulated Cox processes where positiveness conditions can be imposed directly on the GP, with no restrictions on the covariance function. Our approach can also ensure other types of inequality constraints (e.g. monotonicity, convexity), resulting in more versatile models that can be used for other classes of point processes (e.g. renewal processes). We demonstrate on both synthetic and real-world data that our framework accurately infers the intensity functions. Where monotonicity is a feature of the process, our ability to include this in the inference improves results.}

We called our method Implicit Kernel Learning (IKL). The proposed framework is simple to train and inference is performed via sampling random Fourier features. We investigate two applications of the proposed IKL as examples, including generative adversarial networks with MMD (MMD GAN) and standard supervised learning. Empirically, MMD GAN with IKL outperforms vanilla predefined kernels on both image and text generation benchmarks; using IKL with Random Kitchen Sinks also leads to substantial improvement over existing state-of-the-art kernel learning algorithms on popular supervised learning benchmarks. Theory and conditions for using IKL in both applications are also studied as well as connections to previous state-of-the-art methods.}

  abstract	= {Games with continuous strategy sets arise in several machine learning problems (e.g. adversarial learning). For such games, simple no-regret learning algorithms exist in several cases and ensure convergence to coarse correlated equilibria (CCE).  The efficiency of such equilibria with respect to a social function, however, is not well understood. In this paper, we define the class of valid utility games with continuous strategies and provide efficiency bounds for their CCEs. Our bounds rely on the social function being a monotone DR-submodular function. We further refine our bounds based on the curvature of the social function. Furthermore, we extend our efficiency bounds to a class of non-submodular functions that satisfy approximate submodularity properties. Finally, we show that valid utility games with continuous strategies can be designed to maximize monotone DR-submodular functions subject to disjoint constraints with approximation guarantees. The approximation guarantees we derive are based on the efficiency of the equilibria of such games and can improve the existing ones in the literature. We illustrate and validate our results on a budget allocation game and a sensor coverage problem.}

Renyi Differential Privacy can be used to provide (epsilon, delta)-differential privacy guarantees and hence provide a comparison with prior work.

In this paper, we consider this problem as an optimization problem that seeks to maximize the sum of a sum-sum diversity function and a non-negative monotone submodular function. The diversity function addresses the redundancy, and the submodular function controls the predictive quality. We consider the problem in big data settings (in other words, distributed and streaming settings) where the data cannot be stored on a single machine or the process time is too high for a single machine. We show that a greedy algorithm achieves a constant factor approximation of the optimal solution in these settings. Moreover, we formulate the multi-label feature selection problem as such an optimization problem. This formulation combined with our algorithm leads to the first distributed multi-label feature selection method. We compare the performance of this method with centralized multi-label feature selection methods in the literature, and we show that its performance is comparable or in some cases is even better than current centralized multi-label feature selection methods.}

This has two caveats. First, we do not know how to efficiently verify this property of optimal solutions that are NP-hard to compute in the first place. Second, the stability assumptions required for polynomial time $k$-means algorithms are often unreasonable when compared to the ground-truth clusters in real-world data. A consequence of multiplicative perturbation resilience is \emph{center proximity}, that is, every point is closer to the center of its own cluster than the center of any other cluster, by some multiplicative factor $\alpha > 1$.  We study the problem of minimizing the Euclidean $k$-means objective only over clusterings that satisfy $\alpha$-center proximity. We give a simple algorithm to find the optimal $\alpha$-center-proximal $k$-means clustering in running time exponential in $k$ and $1/(\alpha - 1)$ but linear in the number of points and the dimension. We define an analogous $\alpha$-center proximity condition for outliers, and give similar algorithmic guarantees for $k$-means with outliers and $\alpha$-center proximity. On the hardness side we show that for any $\alpha' > 1$, there exists an $\alpha \leq \alpha'$, $(\alpha >1)$, and an $\e_0 > 0$ such that minimizing the $k$-means objective over clusterings that satisfy $\alpha$-center proximity is NP-hard to approximate within a multiplicative $(1+\e_0)$ factor.}

Even a single such evaluation can be prohibitively expensive. Therefore, it is beneficial to use low-cost approximations, like training the learning algorithm on a sub-sampled version of the whole data-set. These low-cost approximations/fidelities can however provide a biased and noisy estimate of the function value. In this work, we combine structured state-space exploration through hierarchical partitioning with querying these partitions at multiple fidelities, and develop a multi-fidelity bandit based tree-search algorithm for noisy black-box optimization.

The knockoff procedure is a recent breakthrough in statistics that, in theory, can identify truly correlated features while guaranteeing that false discovery rate is controlled. The idea is to create synthetic data-knockoffs-that capture correlations among the features. However, there are substantial computational and practical challenges to generating and using knockoffs. This paper makes several key advances that enable knockoff application to be more efficient and powerful. We develop an efficient algorithm to generate valid knockoffs from Bayesian Networks.

To close the amortization gap and improve the training of the generative model, recent works have introduced an additional refinement step that applies stochastic variational inference (SVI) to improve upon the variational parameters returned by the amortized inference model. In this paper, we propose the Buffered Stochastic Variational Inference (BSVI), a new refinement procedure that makes use of SVI’s sequence of intermediate variational proposal distributions and their corresponding importance weights to construct a new generalized importance-weighted lower bound. We demonstrate empirically that training the variational autoencoders with BSVI consistently out-performs SVI, yielding an improved training procedure for VAEs.}

The advantage of knockoffs is that if we have a good model of the features X, then we can identify salient features without knowing anything about how the outcome Y depends on X. An important drawback of knockoffs is its instability: running the procedure twice can result in very different selected features, potentially leading to different conclusions. Addressing this instability is critical for obtaining reproducible and robust results. Here we present a generalization of the knockoff procedure that we call simultaneous multi-knockoffs. We show that multi-knockoffs guarantee false discovery rate (FDR) control, and are substantially more stable and powerful compared to the standard (single) knockoffs.  Moreover we propose a new algorithm based on entropy maximization for generating Gaussian multi-knockoffs. We validate the improved stability and power of multi-knockoffs in systematic experiments.

In this paper we adapt the Cramer distance to deal with arbitrary vectors.

In allowing the model's prediction to be any real vector, we lose the probabilistic interpretation behind the method, but otherwise maintain the appealing properties of distributional approaches.

To achieve this algorithmically, we leverage the classical options framework, and learn the option transition model as a "critic" for the termination function. Using this model, we derive gradients that optimize the desired criteria. We show that the resulting options are non-trivial, intuitively meaningful, and useful for learning.}

Since CATE may not be identified when unconfoundedness is violated, we develop a functional interval estimator that predicts bounds on the individual causal effects under realistic violations of unconfoundedness. Our estimator takes the form of a weighted kernel estimator with weights that vary adversarially. We prove that our estimator is sharp in that it converges exactly to the tightest bounds possible on CATE when there may be unobserved confounders. Further, we study personalized decision rules derived from our estimator and prove that they achieve optimal minimax regret asymptotically.

In this paper, we focus on the approximation of GP posterior at a local level: we define a reusable template to approximate the posterior at neighborhoods while maintaining a global approximation. We first construct a variational distribution such that the inference for a data point considers only its neighborhood, thereby separating the calculation for each data point.

Comparing to previous methods, our method greatly reduces the number of parameters and also the number of optimization iterations. In empirical evaluations, the proposed method significantly speeds up the inference and often gets more accurate results than competing methods.}

  abstract	= {Estimating the dependence structure of multidimensional time series data in real-time is challenging. With large volumes of streaming data, the problem becomes more difficult when the multidimensional data are collected asynchronously across distributed nodes, which motivates us to sample representative data points from streams. We propose a leverage score sampling (LSS) method for efficient online inference of the streaming vector autoregressive (VAR) model. We define the leverage score for the streaming VAR model so that the LSS method selects informative data points in real-time with statistical guarantees of parameter estimation efficiency. Moreover, our LSS method can be directly deployed in an asynchronous decentralized environment, e.g., a sensor network without a fusion center, and produce asynchronous consensus online parameter estimation over time. By exploiting the temporal dependence structure of the VAR model, the LSS method selects samples independently on each dimension and thus is able to update the estimation asynchronously. We illustrate the effectiveness of the LSS method in synthetic, gas sensor and seismic datasets.}

Key to our approach is a novel technique, doubly dual embedding, that avoids computation of the partition function. This technique also allows the development of a flexible sampling strategy that amortizes the cost of Monte-Carlo sampling in the inference stage. The resulting estimator can be easily generalized to kernel conditional exponential families. We establish a connection between kernel exponential family estimation and MMD-GANs, revealing a new perspective for understanding GANs. Compared to the score matching based estimators, the proposed method improves both memory and time efficiency while enjoying stronger statistical properties, such as fully capturing smoothness in its statistical convergence rate while the score matching estimator appears to saturate. Finally, we show that the proposed estimator  empirically outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both kernel exponential family estimation and its conditional extension.}

In this work, we show that the main reason behind this confusion is the inaccurate definition of adversarial perturbation that is used in the literature.  To fix this issue, we propose a slight, yet important modification to the existing definition of adversarial perturbation.  Based on the modified definition, we show that there is no trade-off between adversarial and standard accuracies; there exist classifiers that are robust and achieve high standard accuracy. We further study several properties of this new definition of adversarial risk and its relation to the existing definition.}

A key ingredient in this framework, is the notion of a precomputed statistic, which is maintained in the course of the algorithms. We show that we can easily integrate this idea into a large class of submodular optimization problems including constrained and unconstrained submodular maximization, minimization, difference of submodular optimization, ratio of submodular optimization and several other related optimization problems. Moreover, memoization can be integrated in both discrete and continuous relaxation flavors of algorithms for these problems. We demonstrate this idea for several commonly occurring submodular functions, and show how the pre-computational model provides significant speedups compared to the value oracle model. Finally, we empirically demonstrate this for large scale machine learning problems of data subset selection and summarization.}

Euclidean models ignore such information and assign probability mass to data points that can never appear as data, and vastly different likelihoods to points that are similar under the desired metric.We propose the wrapped Gaussian process latent variable model (WGPLVM), that extends Gaussian process latent variable models to take values strictly on a given Riemannian manifold, making the model blind to impossible data points. This allows non-linear, probabilistic inference of low-dimensional Riemannian submanifolds from data. Our evaluation on diverse datasets show that we improve performance on several tasks, including encoding, visualization and uncertainty quantification.}

The algorithm has one weight vector per class and the surrogate loss is a function of the linear activations (one per class). The surrogate loss  of an example with linear activation vector $\mathbf{a}$ and class $c$ has the form $-\log_{t_1} \exp_{t_2} (a_c - G_{t_2}(\mathbf{a}))$ where the two temperatures $t_1$ and $t_2$ ``temper'' the $\log$ and $\exp$, respectively, and $G_{t_2}(\mathbf{a})$ is a scalar value that generalizes the log-partition function. We motivate this loss using the Tsallis divergence. Our method allows transitioning between non-convex and convex losses by the choice of the temperature parameters. As the temperature $t_1$ of the logarithm becomes smaller than the temperature $t_2$ of the exponential, the surrogate loss becomes ``quasi convex''. Various tunings of the temperatures recover previous methods and tuning the degree of non-convexity is crucial in the experiments. In particular, quasi-convexity and boundedness of the loss provide significant robustness to the outliers. We explain this by showing that $t_1 < 1$ caps the surrogate loss and $t_2 >1$ makes the predictive distribution have a heavy tail.  We show that the surrogate loss is Bayes-consistent, even in the non-convex case. Additionally, we provide efficient iterative algorithms for calculating the log-partition value only in a few number of iterations. Our compelling experimental results on large real-world datasets show the advantage of using the two-temperature variant in the noisy as well as the noise free case.}

They model data with a deep latent-variable model and then fit the model by maximizing a lower bound of the log marginal likelihood. VAEs can capture complex distributions, but they can also suffer from an issue known as "latent variable collapse," especially if the likelihood model is powerful. Specifically, the lower bound involves an approximate posterior of the latent variables; this posterior "collapses" when it is set equal to the prior, i.e., when the approximate posterior is independent of the data. While VAEs learn good generative models, latent variable collapse prevents them from learning useful representations. In this paper, we propose a simple new way to avoid latent variable collapse by including skip connections in our generative model; these connections enforce strong links between the latent variables and the likelihood function. We study generative skip models both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, we prove that skip models increase the mutual information between the observations and the inferred latent variables. Empirically, we study images (MNIST and Omniglot) and text (Yahoo). Compared to existing VAE architectures, we show that generative skip models maintain similar predictive performance but lead to less collapse and provide more meaningful representations of the data.}

Multiplicative latent factors are introduced to study higher-order patterns in players' interactions that distinguish a successful game from a loss. Parameters are estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler. Results in simulation experiments suggest that the sampling scheme is effective in recovering the parameters. We also apply the model to the first high-resolution optical tracking data set collected in college basketball games. The learned latent factors demonstrate significant differences between players' passing and receiving patterns in a loss, as opposed to a win. Our model is applicable to team sports other than basketball, as well as other time-varying network observations.}

To do this, the algorithm creates a hierarchy of covariate combinations on which to match (similar to downward closure), in the process solving an optimization problem for each unit in order to construct the optimal matches. The algorithm uses a single dynamic program to solve all of the units' optimization problems simultaneously. Notable advantages of our method over existing matching procedures are its high-quality interpretable matches, versatility in handling different data distributions that may have irrelevant variables, and ability to handle missing data by matching on as many available covariates as possible.}

Unlike traditional deterministic and stochastic algorithms that attempt to solve the ERM problem for the full training set, we propose an adaptive sample size scheme to reduce the overall computational complexity of finding a local minimum. To be more precise, we first find an approximate local minimum of the ERM problem corresponding to a small number of samples and use the uniform convergence theory to show that if the population risk is a Morse function, by properly increasing the size of training set the iterates generated by the proposed procedure always stay close to a local minimum of the corresponding ERM problem. Therefore, eventually, the proposed procedure finds a local minimum of the ERM corresponding to the full training set which happens to also be close to a local minimum of the expected risk minimization problem with high probability. We formally state the conditions on the size of the initial sample set and characterize the required accuracy for obtaining an approximate local minimum to ensure that the iterates always stay in a neighborhood of a local minimum and do not get attracted to saddle points.}

Our method provides a novel way to topologically simplify the global structure of the model, without having to sacrifice too much of the flexibility of the model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our new topological regularizer on a range of synthetic and real-world datasets.}

  abstract	= {We present a novel algorithm for overcomplete independent components analysis (ICA), where the number of latent sources k exceeds the dimension p of observed variables. Previous algorithms either suffer from high computational complexity or make strong assumptions about the form of the mixing matrix. Our algorithm does not make any sparsity assumption yet enjoys favorable computational and theoretical properties. Our algorithm consists of two main steps: (a) estimation of the Hessians of the cumulant generating function (as opposed to the fourth and higher order cumulants used by most algorithms) and (b) a novel semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxation for recovering a mixing component. We show that this relaxation can be efficiently solved with a projected accelerated gradient descent method, which makes the whole algorithm computationally practical. Moreover, we conjecture that the proposed program recovers a mixing component at the rate $k < p^2/4$ and prove that a mixing component can be recovered with high probability when $k <(2 - \epsilon)p\log p$ when the original components are sampled uniformly at random on the hyper sphere. Experiments are provided on synthetic data and the CIFAR-10 dataset of real images.}

We provide a sandwich bound on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective that can be made arbitrarily tight. Unlike discriminator-based and kernel-based approaches to implicit variational inference, DSIVI optimizes a proper lower bound on ELBO that is asymptotically exact. We evaluate DSIVI on a set of problems that benefit from implicit priors. In particular, we show that DSIVI gives rise to a simple modification of VampPrior, the current state-of-the-art prior for variational autoencoders, which improves its performance.}

The number of outputs can be much larger than or comparable to the size of training samples. Existing multi-output GP models either are limited to low-dimensional outputs and restricted kernel choices,  or assume oversimplified low-rank structures within the outputs. To address these issues, we propose HOGPR, a High-Order Gaussian Process Regression model, which can flexibly capture complex correlations among the outputs and scale up to a large number of outputs. Specifically, we tensorize the high-dimensional outputs, introducing latent coordinate features to index each tensor element (i.e., output) and to capture their correlations. We then generalize a multilinear model to a hybrid of a GP and latent GP model. The model is endowed with a Kronecker product structure over the inputs and the latent features. Using the Kronecker product properties and tensor algebra, we are able to perform exact inference over millions of outputs. We show the advantage of the proposed model on several real-world applications.}

In this paper, we present kernel embedding likelihood-free inference (KELFI), a holistic framework that automatically learns model hyperparameters to improve inference accuracy given limited simulation budget. By leveraging likelihood smoothness with conditional mean embeddings, we nonparametrically approximate likelihoods and posteriors as surrogate densities and sample from closed-form posterior mean embeddings, whose hyperparameters are learned under its approximate marginal likelihood.

For example, the vector of residual/primal variables has to be maintained when CD is applied for Lasso/linear SVM, respectively. An implementation without maintenance is $O(n)$ times slower than the one with maintenance, where n is the number of variables. In serial implementations, maintaining auxiliary variables is only a computing trick without changing the behavior of coordinate descent. However, maintenance of auxiliary variables is non-trivial when there are multiple threads/workers which read/write the auxiliary variables concurrently. Thus, most existing theoretical analysis of parallel CD either assumes vanilla CD without auxiliary variables (which ends up being extremely slow in practice) or limits to a small class of problems. In this paper, we consider a rich family of objective functions where AUX-PCD can be applied. We also establish global linear convergence for AUX-PCD with atomic operations for a general family of functions and perform a complete backward error analysis of AUX-PCD with wild updates, where some updates are not just delayed but lost because of memory conflicts. Our results enable us to provide theoretical guarantees for many practical parallel coordinate descent implementations, which currently lack guarantees (such as the implementation of Shotgun by Bradley et al. 2011, which uses auxiliary variables)}

We introduce the concepts of value functions, baselines and critics for arbitrary SCGs, and show how to use them to derive lower-variance gradient estimates from partial model evaluations, paving the way towards general and efficient credit assignment for gradient-based optimization.

We address this issue by proposing a Gaussian process model that considers the individual function outputs and derive a distribution over the resulting 2-norm.

We show that this optimization problem, in turn, can be efficiently approximated by neural networks. The resulting formulation, called the correspondence analysis neural network (CA-NN), enables CA to be performed at an unprecedented scale. We validate the CA-NN on synthetic data, and demonstrate how it can be used to perform CA on a variety of datasets, including food recipes, wine compositions, and images.

This paper studies the Sinkhorn divergences, a family of geometric divergences that interpolates between MMD and OT. Relying on a new notion of geometric entropy, we provide theoretical guarantees for these divergences: positivity, convexity and metrization of the convergence in law.

Empirical results illustrate potential practicality of these algorithms in low dimensions and significant improvement over standard approaches in some settings.}

One of the major problems with MCMC is the question of how to design chains that mix fast over the whole state space; in particular, how to select the parameters of an MCMC algorithm. Here we take a different approach and, similarly to parallel MCMC methods, instead of trying to find a single chain that samples from the whole distribution, we combine samples from several chains run in parallel, each exploring only parts of the state space (e.g., a few modes only). The chains are prioritized based on the kernel Stein discrepancy, which provides a good measure of performance locally. The samples from the independent chains are combined using a novel technique for estimating the probability of different regions of the sample space. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm may provide significant speedups in different sampling problems. Most importantly, when combined with the state-of-the-art NUTS algorithm as the base MCMC sampler, our method remained competitive with NUTS on sampling from unimodal distributions, while significantly outperformed state-of-the-art competitors on synthetic multimodal problems as well as on a challenging sensor localization task.}

We explore this under the idealized assumptions that the variational approximation is a mean-field Gaussian density and that the log of the joint density of the model parameters and the data is a quadratic function that depends on the variational mean. From this, we show that the marginal variances of the reparameterization gradient estimator are smaller than those of the score function gradient estimator.

In this paper, we propose a stochastic variance-reduced cubic-regularization (SVRC) method under random sampling, and study its convergence guarantee as well as sample complexity. We show that the iteration complexity of SVRC for achieving a second-order stationary solution within $\epsilon$ accuracy is $O(\epsilon^{-3/2})$, which matches the state-of-art result on CR types methods. Moreover, our proposed variance reduction scheme significantly reduces the per-iteration sample complexity. The resulting total Hessian sample complexity of our SVRC is $O(N^{2/3} \epsilon^{-3/2})$, which outperforms the state-of-art result by a factor of $O(N^{2/15})$. We also study our SVRC under random sampling without replacement scheme, which yields a lower per-iteration sample complexity, and hence justifies its practical applicability.}

The core idea is to use a variational lower bound to the NCE objective function, which can be optimised in the same fashion as the evidence lower bound (ELBO) in standard variational inference (VI). We prove that VNCE can be used for both parameter estimation of unnormalised models and posterior inference of latent variables. The developed theory shows that VNCE has the same level of generality as standard VI, meaning that advances made there can be directly imported to the unnormalised setting.

  abstract	= {We provide a series of results for unsupervised learning with autoencoders.  Specifically, we study shallow two-layer autoencoder architectures with shared weights. We focus on three generative models for data that are common in statistical machine learning: (i) the mixture-of-gaussians model, (ii) the sparse coding model, and (iii) the sparsity model with non-negative coefficients. For each of these models, we prove that under suitable choices of hyperparameters, architectures, and initialization, autoencoders learned by gradient descent can successfully recover the parameters of the corresponding model. To our knowledge, this is the first result that rigorously studies the dynamics of gradient descent for weight-sharing autoencoders. Our analysis can be viewed as theoretical evidence that shallow autoencoder modules indeed can be used as feature learning mechanisms for a variety of data models, and may shed insight on how to train larger stacked architectures with autoencoders as basic building blocks.}

In this paper, we consider greedy updates that are based on subgradients for a class of non-smooth composite problems, including $L1$-regularized problems, SVMs and related applications. For these problems we provide (i) the first linear rates of convergence independent of $n$, and show that our greedy update rule provides speedups similar to those obtained in the smooth case. This was previously conjectured to be true for a stronger greedy coordinate selection strategy.  Furthermore, we show that (ii) our new selection rule can be mapped to instances of maximum inner product search, allowing to leverage standard nearest neighbor algorithms to speed up the implementation. We demonstrate the validity of the approach through extensive numerical experiments.}

However, collapsing variables is computationally expensive, since it changes the PGM structure introducing factors whose size is dependent upon the Markov blanket of the variable. Therefore, collapsing out several variables jointly is typically intractable in arbitrary PGM structures. In this paper, we propose an adaptive approach for Rao-Blackwellisation, where we add parallel Markov chains defined over different collapsed PGM structures. The collapsed variables are chosen based on their convergence diagnostics. However, adding a new chain requires burn-in, thus wasting samples. To address this, we initialize the new chains from a mean field approximation for the distribution, that improves over time, thus reducing the burn-in period. Our experiments on several UAI benchmarks shows that our approach is more accurate than state-of-the-art inference systems such as Merlin that implements algorithms that have previously won the UAI inference challenge.}

We are given logged historical data consisting of contexts, (randomized) actions, and (nonnegative) rewards. A common goal is to evaluate what would happen if different actions were taken in the same contexts, so as to optimize the action policies accordingly. The typical approach to this problem, inverse probability weighted estimation (IPWE), requires logged action probabilities, which may be missing in practice due to engineering complications. Even when available, small action probabilities cause large uncertainty in IPWE, rendering the corresponding results insignificant. To solve both problems, we show how one can use policy improvement (PIL) objectives, regularized by policy imitation (IML). We motivate and analyze PIL as an extension to Clipped-IPWE, by showing that both are lower-bound surrogates to the vanilla IPWE. We also formally connect IML to IPWE variance estimation and natural policy gradients. Without probability logging, our PIL-IML interpretations justify and improve, by reward-weighting, the state-of-art cross-entropy (CE) loss that predicts the action items among all action candidates available in the same contexts. With probability logging, our main theoretical contribution connects IML-underfitting to the existence of either confounding variables or model misspecification. We show the value and accuracy of our insights by simulations based on Simpson's paradox, standard UCI multiclass-to-bandit conversions and on the Criteo counterfactual analysis challenge dataset.}

In addition, we show that the probability of candidate generation in our algorithm is consistent with the true ranking induced by the value of the corresponding inner products, and derive the sample complexity of Sampling-MIPS to obtain the true candidate. Furthermore, the algorithm can be easily extended to large problems with sparse candidate vectors. Experimental results on real and synthetic datasets show that Sampling-MIPS is consistently better than other previous approaches such as LSH-MIPS, PCA-MIPS and Diamond sampling approach.}

It can hardly be applied to other learning tasks such as regression trees because extending the BSP-Tree process to a higher dimensional space is nontrivial. This paper is the first attempt to extend the BSP-Tree process to a d-dimensional ($d>2$) space. We propose to generate a cutting hyperplane, which is assumed to be parallel to $d-2$ dimensions, to cut each node in the d-dimensional BSP-tree. By designing a subtle strategy to sample two free dimensions from d dimensions, the extended BSP-Tree process can inherit the essential self-consistency property from the original version. Based on the extended BSP-Tree process, an ensemble model, which is named the BSP-Forest, is further developed for regression tasks. Thanks to the retained self-consistency property, we can thus significantly reduce the geometric calculations in the inference stage. Compared to its counterpart, the Mondrian Forest, the BSP-Forest can achieve similar performance with fewer cuts due to its flexibility. The BSP-Forest also outperforms other (Bayesian) regression forests on a number of real-world data sets.}

We first prove that solving this problem is NP-hard. We then propose an efficient algorithm that finds a policy whose performance is almost as good as that of the best convex combination of the base policies, under the assumption that the occupancy measures of the base policies have a large overlap. The running time of the proposed algorithm is linear in the number of states and polynomial in the number of base policies. A distinct advantage of the proposed algorithm is that, apart from the computation of the occupancy measures of the base policies, it does not need to interact with the environment during the optimization process. This is especially important (i) in problems that due to concerns such as safety, we are restricted in interacting with the environment only through the (safe) base policies, and (ii) in complex systems where estimating the value of a policy can be a time consuming process.}

We prove our result on a fixed dataset, both for sampling with or without replacement. Furthermore, for logistic loss (and similar exponentially-tailed losses), we prove that with SGD the weight vector converges in direction to the $L_2$ max margin vector as $O(1/\log(t))$ for almost all separable datasets, and the loss converges as $O(1/t)$ --- similarly to gradient descent. Lastly, we examine the case of a fixed learning rate proportional to the minibatch size. We prove that in this case, the asymptotic convergence rate of SGD (with replacement) does not depend on the minibatch size in terms of epochs, if the support vectors span the data.

An interpretable, statistical framework is introduced for training these nonlinear networks based on a maximum-likelihood objective function. To learn network parameters, stochastic gradient descent is applied to the objective, and is stable until convergence. This direct optimization does not involve back-propagation over separate encoder and decoder networks, or adversarial training of dueling networks. While training remains tractable for moderately sized networks, Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approximations of gradients are derived for deep networks which contain latent variables.

Aspects of the model's framework such as interpretability, computational complexity, and generalization ability are discussed.}

The algorithm is based on a reduction of control of Markov decision processes to an expert prediction problem. In practice, it corresponds to a variant of policy iteration with forced exploration, where the policy in each phase is greedy with respect to the average of all previous value functions.  This is the first model-free algorithm for adaptive control of LQ systems that provably achieves sublinear regret and has a polynomial computation cost.

We dramatically shrink the amount of interactions with the environment necessary to learn well-behaved imitation policies, by up to several orders of magnitude. Our framework, operating in the model-free regime, exhibits a significant increase in sample-efficiency over previous methods by simultaneously a) learning a self-tuned adversarially-trained surrogate reward and b) leveraging an off-policy actor-critic architecture. We show that our approach is simple to implement and that the learned agents remain remarkably stable, as shown in our experiments that span a variety of continuous control tasks.

For example, when optimizing a physical system, intelligently trading off computer simulations and real-world tests can lead to significant savings. Existing multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization methods, such as multi-fidelity GP-UCB or Entropy Search-based approaches, either make simplistic assumptions on the interaction among different fidelities or use simple heuristics that lack theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we study multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization with complex structural dependencies among multiple outputs, and propose MF-MI-Greedy, a principled algorithmic framework for addressing this problem. In particular, we model different fidelities using additive Gaussian processes based on shared latent relationships with the target function. Then we use cost-sensitive mutual information gain for efficient Bayesian optimization. We propose a simple notion of regret which incorporates the varying cost of different fidelities, and prove that MF-MI-Greedy achieves low regret. We demonstrate the strong empirical performance of our algorithm on both synthetic and real-world datasets.}

Our objective is to learn strategies for selecting a test that gives the best trade-off between accuracy and costs in such unsupervised sensor selection (USS) problems. Clearly, learning is feasible only if ground truth can be inferred (explicitly or implicitly) from the problem structure. It is observed that this happens if the problem satisfies the 'Weak Dominance' (WD) property. We set up the USS problem as a stochastic partial monitoring problem and develop an algorithm with sub-linear regret under the WD property. We argue that our algorithm is optimal and evaluate its performance on problem instances generated from synthetic and real-world datasets.}

In this work, we seek to further accelerate the convergence rate of online imitation learning, thereby making it more sample efficient. We propose two model-based algorithms inspired by Follow-the-Leader (FTL) with prediction: MoBIL-VI based on solving variational inequalities and MoBIL-Prox based on stochastic first-order updates. These two methods leverage a model to predict future gradients to speed up policy learning. When the model oracle is learned online, these algorithms can provably accelerate the best known convergence rate up to an order.

Brillinger (1982) showed that ordinary least-squares estimates $\mathbf{x}_0$ up to a constant of proportionality $\mu_\ell$, which depends on $f$. Recently, Plan \& Vershynin (2015) extended this result to the high-dimensional setting deriving sharp error bounds for the generalized Lasso. Unfortunately, both least-squares and the Lasso fail to recover $\mathbf{x}_0$ when  $\mu_\ell=0$. For example, this includes all even link functions. We resolve this issue by proposing and analyzing an alternative convex recovery method. In a nutshell, our method treats such link functions as if they were linear in a lifted space of higher-dimension. Interestingly, our error analysis captures the effect of both the nonlinearity and the problem's geometry in a few simple summary parameters.}

Markov Logic is a powerful formalism which achieves this by attaching weights to formulas in finite first-order logic. Though Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) have been used for a wide variety of applications, a significant challenge remains that weights do not generalize well when training domain sizes are different from those seen during testing. In particular, it has been observed that marginal probabilities tend to extremes in the limit of increasing domain sizes. As the first contribution of our work, we further characterize the distribution and show that marginal probabilities tend to a constant independent of weights and not always to extremes as was previously observed. As our second contribution, we present a principled solution to this problem by defining Domain-size Aware Markov Logic Networks (DA-MLNs) which can be seen as re-parameterizing the MLNs after taking domain size into consideration. For some simple but representative MLN formulas, we formally prove that probabilities defined by DA-MLNs are well behaved. On a practical side, DA-MLNs allow us to generalize the weights learned over small-sized training data to much larger domains. Experiments on three different benchmark MLNs show that our approach results in significant performance gains compared to existing methods.}

Unfortunately, this research has primarily focused on distributions defined in Euclidean space, ruling out the usage of one of the most influential class of spaces with non-trivial topologies: Lie groups. In this work we define a general framework to create reparameterizable densities on arbitrary Lie groups, and provide a detailed practitioners guide to further the ease of usage. We demonstrate how to create complex and multimodal distributions on the well known oriented group of 3D rotations, SO{3}, using normalizing flows.

In this paper, we try to understand BN from an optimization perspective by providing an explicit objective function associated with BN. This explicit objective function reveals that: 1) BN, rather than being a new optimization algorithm or trick, is creating a different objective function instead of the one in our common sense; and 2) why BN may not work well in some scenarios.  We then propose a refinement of BN based on the compositional optimization technique called Full Normalization (FN) to alleviate the issues of BN when the batches are not constructed ideally. The convergence analysis and empirical study for FN are also included in this paper.}

It is shown that this approach results in the algorithm having a low complexity implementation whose computational cost is significantly smaller than the existing algorithms for higher dimensional search space $\X$. Furthermore, high probability bounds on a measure of discrepancy between the estimated level set and the true level set for the  the proposed algorithm are obtained, which are shown to be strictly better than the existing guarantees for a large class of GPs.In the process, a tighter characterization of the information gain of the proposed algorithm is obtained which takes into account the structured nature of the evaluation points.

The ``default'' prior is a standard normal, but if the natural factors of variation in the dataset exhibit discrete structure or are not independent, then the isotropic-normal prior will actually encourage learning representations that \emph{mask} this structure. To alleviate this problem, we propose using a flexible Bayesian nonparametric hierarchical clustering prior based on the time-marginalized coalescent (TMC). To scale learning to large datasets, we develop a new inducing-point approximation and inference algorithm. We then apply the method without supervision to several datasets and examine the interpretability and practical performance of the inferred hierarchies and learned latent space.}

The objective is to identify an $\epsilon$-optimal ranking of the $n$ items with probability at least $1 - \delta$. When the feedback in each subset round is a single Plackett-Luce-sampled item, we show $(\epsilon, \delta)$-PAC algorithms with a sample complexity of $O\left(\frac{n}{\epsilon^2} \ln \frac{n}{\delta} \right)$ rounds, which we establish as being order-optimal by exhibiting a matching sample complexity lower bound of $\Omega\left(\frac{n}{\epsilon^2} \ln \frac{n}{\delta} \right)$---this shows that there is essentially no improvement possible from the pairwise comparisons setting ($k = 2$). When, however, it is possible to elicit top-$m$ ($\leq k$) ranking feedback according to the PL model from each adaptively chosen subset of size $k$, we show that an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-PAC ranking sample complexity of $O\left(\frac{n}{m \epsilon^2} \ln \frac{n}{\delta} \right)$ is achievable with explicit algorithms, which represents an $m$-wise reduction in sample complexity compared to the pairwise case. This again turns out to be order-wise unimprovable across the class of symmetric ranking algorithms. Our algorithms rely on a novel {pivot trick} to maintain only $n$ itemwise score estimates, unlike $O(n^2)$ pairwise score estimates that has been used in prior work. We report results of numerical experiments that corroborate our findings.}

However, estimating the latter is a formidable task due to the estimation of a high dimensional probability density and intractable integrals. In this work, we show that for linear classifiers this task can be considerably simplified, leading to a one dimensional integral for which we propose an efficient approximation.

(b) how does the rate of margin convergence depend on the tail of the loss function and the choice of the step size? We  show that for a large family of super-polynomial tailed losses, gradient descent iterates on linear networks of any depth converge in the direction of $L_2$ maximum-margin solution, while this does not hold for losses with heavier tails. Within this family, for simple linear models we show that the optimal rates with fixed step size is indeed obtained for the commonly used exponentially tailed losses such as logistic loss. However, with a fixed step size the optimal convergence rate is extremely slow as $1/\log(t)$, as also proved in Soudry et al (2018). For linear models with exponential loss, we further prove that the convergence rate could be improved to $\log (t) /\sqrt{t}$  by using aggressive step sizes that compensates for the rapidly vanishing gradients. Numerical results suggest this method might be useful for deep networks.}

  author	= {Esmaeili, Babak and Huang, Hongyi and Wallace, Byron and Meent, Jan-Willem van de},
  pages		= {3429-3439},
  abstract	= {We present Variational Aspect-based Latent Topic Allocation (VALTA), a family of autoencoding topic models that learn aspect-based representations of reviews. VALTA defines a user-item encoder that maps bag-of-words vectors for combined reviews associated with each paired user and item onto structured embeddings, which in turn define per-aspect topic weights. We model individual reviews in a structured manner by inferring an aspect assignment for each sentence in a given review, where the per-aspect topic weights obtained by the user-item encoder serve to define a mixture over topics, conditioned on the aspect. The result is an autoencoding neural topic model for reviews, which can be trained in a fully unsupervised manner to learn topics that are structured into aspects. Experimental evaluation on large number of datasets demonstrates that aspects are interpretable, yield higher coherence scores than non-structured autoencoding topic model variants, and can be utilized to perform aspect-based comparison and genre discovery.}

  pages		= {3440-3448},
  abstract	= {We develop a new theoretical framework, the envelope complexity, to analyze the minimax regret with logarithmic loss functions. Within the framework, we derive a Bayesian predictor that adaptively achieves the minimax regret over high-dimensional l1-balls within a factor of two. The prior is newly derived for achieving the minimax regret and called the spike-and-tails (ST) prior as it looks like. The resulting regret bound is so simple that it is completely determined with the smoothness of the loss function and the radius of the balls except with logarithmic factors, and it has a generalized form of existing regret/risk bounds.}

  author	= {Stojanov, Petar and Gong, Mingming and Carbonell, Jaime and Zhang, Kun},
  pages		= {3449-3458},
  abstract	= {Covariate shift is a prevalent setting for supervised learning in the wild when the training and test data are drawn from different time periods, different but related domains, or via different sampling strategies.  This paper addresses a transfer learning setting, with covariate shift between source and target domains. Most existing methods for correcting covariate shift exploit density ratios of the features to reweight the source-domain data, and when the features are high-dimensional, the estimated density ratios may suffer large estimation variances, leading to poor performance of prediction under covariate shift. In this work, we investigate the dependence of covariate shift correction performance on the dimensionality of the features, and  propose a correction method that finds a low-dimensional representation of the features, which takes into account feature relevant to the target $Y$, and exploits the density ratio of this representation for importance reweighting. We discuss the factors that affect the performance of our method, and demonstrate its capabilities on both pseudo-real data and real-world applications.}

  pages		= {3459-3467},
  abstract	= {Probabilistic classifiers output a probability distribution on target classes rather than just a class prediction. Besides providing a clear separation of prediction and decision making, the main advantage of probabilistic models is their ability to represent uncertainty about predictions. In safety-critical applications, it is pivotal for a model to possess an adequate sense of uncertainty, which for probabilistic classifiers translates into outputting probability distributions that are consistent with the empirical frequencies observed from realized outcomes. A classifier with such a property is called calibrated. In this work, we develop a general theoretical calibration evaluation framework grounded in probability theory, and point out subtleties present in model calibration evaluation that lead to refined interpretations of existing evaluation techniques. Lastly, we propose new ways to quantify and visualize miscalibration in probabilistic classification, including novel multidimensional reliability diagrams.}

  pages		= {3468-3477},
  abstract	= {This paper focuses on the problem of \emph{constrained} \emph{stochastic} optimization. A zeroth order Frank-Wolfe algorithm is proposed, which in addition to the projection-free nature of the vanilla Frank-Wolfe algorithm makes it gradient free. Under convexity and smoothness assumption, we show that the proposed algorithm converges to the optimal objective function at a rate $O\left(1/T^{1/3}\right)$, where $T$ denotes the iteration count. In particular, the primal sub-optimality gap is shown to have a dimension dependence of $O\left(d^{1/3}\right)$, which is the best known dimension dependence among all zeroth order optimization algorithms with one directional derivative per iteration. For non-convex functions, we obtain the \emph{Frank-Wolfe} gap to be $O\left(d^{1/3}T^{-1/4}\right)$. Experiments on black-box optimization setups demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.}

  abstract	= {Unobserved confounding is a central barrier to drawing causal inferences from observational data. Several authors have recently proposed that this barrier can be overcome in the case where one attempts to infer the effects of several variables simultaneously.  In this paper, we present two simple, analytical counterexamples that challenge the general claims that are central to these approaches. We discuss some reasons for these failures and suggest directions for obtaining sufficient conditions for causal identifiaciton. Despite these negative results, we show that a simple modification to the multi-cause setting, incorporating a proxy or negative control variable, solves many of the problems highlighted by the examples, and suggest a way forward for causal inference with high-dimensional action spaces.}

  abstract	= {A key problem in domain adaptation is determining what to transfer across different domains. We propose a data-driven method to represent these changes across multiple source domains and perform unsupervised domain adaptation. We assume that the joint distributions follow a specific generating process and have a small number of identifiable changing parameters, and develop a data-driven method to identify the changing parameters by learning low-dimensional representations of the changing class-conditional distributions across multiple source domains. The learned low-dimensional representations enable us to reconstruct the target-domain joint distribution from unlabeled target-domain data, and further enable predicting the labels in the target domain. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method by conducting experiments on synthetic and real datasets.}
